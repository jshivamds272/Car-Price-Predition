# Car-Price-Predition
I have used Linear Regression to predict the price of Car by given some features  and find accuracy of model.

Linear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).

When there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression. When there are multiple input variables, literature from statistics often refers to the method as multiple linear regression.

Different techniques can be used to prepare or train the linear regression equation from data, the most common of which is called Ordinary Least Squares. It is common to therefore refer to a model prepared this way as Ordinary Least Squares Linear Regression or just Least Squares Regression.

Y(pred) = b0 + b1*x

The values b0 and b1 must be chosen so that they minimize the error. If sum of squared error is taken as a metric to evaluate the model, then goal to obtain a line that best reduces the error.

For model with one predictor,

For This project I have to predict price of car based on the given featres like--
                                                                          
1-Price--> Price of car(target variable)

2-Levy--> levy of car

3-Manufacturer--> manufacturer of car

4-Model--> Model name of car

5-Prod. year--> production year of car

6-Category--> category of car

7-Leather interior--> type of leather 

8-Fuel type-->  types of fuel (petrol, deasal, cng)

9=Engine volume-->  volume of engine of car

10-Mileage--> milage of car

11-Cylinders--> cylinders in car

12-Gear box type-->  gear box type of car

13-Drive wheels-->  types of driving wheels in car

14-Doors--> no. of doors in car

15-Wheel--> no. of wheels in car

16-Color--> color of car 

17-Airbags--> no of airbags of car
